      <description>Categories help you store your bookmarked novel in custom tabs, which keeps your library neat and organized. You can name and sort them however you want according to your preference (ie. Genre, Reading Status, etc).
You can even add your bookmarked novel in multiple categories and can easily control the update options through Library settings and automatically download new novel chapters from certain categories (if Download new chapters option is enabled in Downloads settings).</description>
